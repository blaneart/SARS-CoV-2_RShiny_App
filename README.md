# SARS-CoV-2_RShiny_App
## RShiny application for SARS-CoV-2 genome analysis
This analysis is hardly based on this [notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/abishpius/covid-19-genome-proteins-analysis-with-biopython). This application consist of GC-content graph and data frame of Amino Acid Sequences longer than 20 as this is the smallest known functional protein ([here](https://www.science20.com/princerain/blog/smallest_protein) and [here](http://proteopedia.org/wiki/index.php/1l2y)).
This project is built using [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com), [seqinr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/seqinr/index.html) and [Biostrings](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/Biostrings.html) libraries.
